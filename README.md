# saltstack-debian-config

I recently had to reinstall my laptops Ubuntu OS due to broken pkgs. \

I installed Mint 17 instead and now need to get all my apps re-installed.

Instead of re-installing common apps that I need for work (VMware workstation, VLC player, PlayOnLinux, Vagrant, Docker, etc), I decided to automate the process in case I have to reprovision my laptop's OS again. I wrote a few state files and installed SaltStack on my laptop (configured as both master and minion). Then used Salt to install and configure all these applications..

Salt is freaking AMAZEBALLS!
